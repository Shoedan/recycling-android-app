Forest communities can find themselves evicted as a result of the search for cheap timber and rivers can be damned or polluted by manufacturing waste. \nIt\'s far better to recycle existing products than to damage someone else\'s community or land in the search for new raw materials.</string>

Sometimes it\'s a huge difference in energy. For example: \nProducing new aluminium from old products (including recycled cans and foil) uses 95% less energy than making it from scratch. For steel it\'s about a 70% energy saving. \nMaking paper from pulped recycled paper uses 40% less energy than making it from virgin wood fibres. The amount of energy saved from recycling one glass bottle could power an old 100-watt light bulb for 4 hours and a new low-energy LED equivalent for a lot longer.</string>

It also keeps potentially methane-releasing waste out of landfill sites. \nReducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere is vital for stopping disastrous climate change.</string>
